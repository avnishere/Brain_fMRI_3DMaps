# Brain_fMRI_3DMaps
Novel Algorithm for 3d MAPS analysis in brain fMRI images
Perivascular Spaces (PVS) are 
fluid filled spaces surrounding the small vessels in the
brain which in their enlarged forms are visible on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The
segmented PVS are available with feature descriptors like size, orientation etc. The project
aims at evolving methods such as the Self Organizing Maps (SOM) to discover Region
of Interest (ROI) and understand the role of PVS as an indicator of dementia, stroke,
hypertension and other relevant diseases. The objective is to map normal and patient PVS
data and use the comparison to predict possible cases of the above mentioned diseases as
early signs of the same.
